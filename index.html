                    <h3>Mathematics</h3>
                    <p>Throughout my undergrad I learned various
                        topics in mathematics which has made me
                        an analytical thinker. As an underclassman 
                        I took a lot of computational courses such as
                        calculus 3, linear algebra, differential equations
                        and discrete math. Later in my undergrad I focused 
                        more on abstract mathematics which entailed courses 
                        like differential geometry, abstract algebra, and
                        numerical methods. These courses have allowed me to 
                        have an analytical approach to problem solving.

                    <h3>Computer Science</h3>
                    <p>The specialization aspect of my degree was based in computer science.
                        I took a wide range of computer science courses including data 
                        structures and algorithms, operating systems, web development,
                        cyber security, computer programing language, and even game development.
                        These courses were mainly taught in python making python my most used language.
                        But I also learned html, css, javascript, and Java. I am skilled at front end 
                        web development and I am eager to learn more backend frameworks.

                    <p>Every year I shock my friends with the sheer number of minutes I listen to spotify
                        on my spotify wrapped. With that said I have always dabbled with making media. I 
                        have made a countless number of beats with FL Studio. In high school when I played 
                        a lot of video games I got really good at editing videos and clips using Adobe software.
                        These assets have proven useful when I had to make promotional videos and media.

            <div class="about-me__body">
                <p>Aye, what's good? I am Aro Ntatin, a 22 year old new graduate. During my undergrad I studied applied mathematics 
                    and computer science at the University of Tulsa since 2017. I grew up in Saint Louis Missouri and developed a 
                    passion for sports, music, and video games. Throughout my lifetime I have been able to observe the speedy evolution 
                    of various technologies. In high school when I thought about what I wanted to focus on in school it was a simple 
                    decision. Technology is fast moving and will transform our lives. So I decided to combine my knowledge of computer 
                    science and mathematics to give myself the ability to contribute my own skills to the evolution of technology.
                </p>
                <p>I am extremely ambitious and I want to succeed in this field the best I can. I am continuous learner and I understand 
                    the vast knowledge within computer science. I want to learn as much as I can and by working for a tech company will 
                    give me the opportunity for more hands on experience which is so valuable in this field of work. Catch me at the 
                    Saint Louis Chess Club or on the basketball court.
